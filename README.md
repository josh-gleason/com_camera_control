Minimal `comtypes` python script to expose webcam settings. Currently allows user to set manual focus but easily extended.

No usage restrictions, but feel free to star this if you like it.

Requires Windows, tested using Python 3.12 and comtypes 1.4.11

### Install Dependencies
  ```
  pip install comtypes
  ```

### Run script
  ```
  pyhon main.py
  ```

  This simple run script lets user select a camera and change the focus. That's it. The code was written for me to learn how to do this.
